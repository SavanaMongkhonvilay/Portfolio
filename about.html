        <h1> I'm a Web Development student at JCCC</h1>
        <p> &emsp; I’m currently in my third semester of the Web Development 
            program at Johnson County Community College, 
            where I’ve discovered a passion for both development 
            and design. My goal is to build a career in Front-End 
            Web Development or User Interface Design, where I can 
            combine creativity with technical skill to craft engaging 
            digital experiences. <br> <br>
            
            &emsp; Along the way, I’ve gained experience working with Figma 
            and WordPress, and I’ve studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, 
            and Python. I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving through 
            code as much as I enjoy the process of bringing designs to 
            life on the screen. <br> <br>

            &emsp; Beyond the classroom, I serve as President and Co-Founder of 
            the Developing Diversity Club at JCCC. Our mission is to 
            provide space and resources for marginalized voices in STEM, 
            because I believe everyone deserves the opportunity to 
            thrive in tech. Diversity fuels creativity and innovation, 
            and I’m passionate about contributing to a more inclusive 
            industry. <br> <br>

            &emsp; Outside of designing and building websites, I explore my 
            other passions, including music, gaming, and spending time 
            in nature. Playing guitar is one of my favorite creative 
            outlets, and I’m also a big fan of cozy games and tabletop 
            RPGs. When the weather is nice, you’ll often find me camping 
            and enjoying the outdoors.
